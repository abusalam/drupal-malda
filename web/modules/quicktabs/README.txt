Quicktabs

Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module provides a form for admins to create a block of tabbed content by
selecting a view, a node, a block or an existing Quicktabs instance as the content
of each tab.
The module can be extended to display other types of content.


Installation & Use:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Enable module in module list located at administer > structure > modules.
2.  Go to admin/structure/quicktabs and click on "Add Quicktabs Instance".
3.  Add a title (this will be the block title) and start entering information for your tabs
4.  Use the Add another tab button to add more tabs.
5.  Use the drag handles on the left to re-arrange tabs.
6.  Once you have defined all the tabs, click 'Save'.
7.  Be sure to FLUSH THE CACHE - when working with blocks you need to flush the cache whenever you make a change
8.  You new block will be available at admin/structure/blocks.
9.  Configure & enable it as required.

Note:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because Quicktabs allows your tabbed content to be pulled via ajax, it has its
own menu callback for getting this content and returning it in JSON format. For
node content, it uses the standard node_access check to make sure the user has
access to this content. It is important to note that ANY node can be viewed
from this menu callback; if you go to it directly at quicktabs/ajax/node/[nid]
it will return a JSON text string of the node information. If there are certain 
fields in ANY of your nodes that are supposed to be private, these MUST be 
controlled at admin/content/node-type/MY_NODE_TYPE/display by setting them to 
be excluded on teaser and node view. Setting them as private through some other 
mechanism, e.g. Panels, will not affect their being displayed in an ajax Quicktab.

For Developers:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One way to extend Quicktabs is to add a renderer plugin. Quicktabs comes with
3 renderer plugins: jQuery UI Tabs, jQuery UI Accordion, and classic Quicktabs. A
renderer plugin is a class that extends the QuickRenderer class and implements the 
render() method, returning a render array that can be passed to drupal_render().
See any of the existing renderer plugins for examples. Also see Quicktabs' implement-
ation of hook_quicktabs_renderers().

Lastly, Quicktabs can be extended by adding new types of entities that can be loaded
as tab content. Quicktabs itself provides the node, block, view, qtabs and callback
tab content types. Your contents plugins should extend the QuickContent class. See
the existing plugins and the hook_quicktabs_contents implementation for guidance.
